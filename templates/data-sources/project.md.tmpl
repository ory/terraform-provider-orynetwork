# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Fetches information about an Ory project.

This data source retrieves basic metadata about a project. It can look up the project configured in the provider, or a specific project by ID.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/ory_project/data-source.tf" }}

## ID Fallback Behavior

If `id` is not specified, the data source uses the `project_id` from the provider configuration. If neither is available, the read will fail with an error.

This data source returns project metadata including name, slug, state, workspace, environment, and home region. Use `ory_project_config` to manage project settings.
