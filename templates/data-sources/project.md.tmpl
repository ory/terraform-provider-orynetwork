# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Fetches information about an Ory project.

This data source retrieves basic metadata about a project. It can look up the project configured in the provider, or a specific project by ID.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/data-sources/ory_project/data-source.tf" }}

## ID Fallback Behavior

If `id` is not specified, the data source uses the `project_id` from the provider configuration. If neither is available, the read will fail with an error.

~> **Note:** This data source only returns basic project metadata (name, slug, state, workspace). It does not include the project's `environment`, `home_region`, or detailed configuration. Use `ory_project_config` to manage project settings.
