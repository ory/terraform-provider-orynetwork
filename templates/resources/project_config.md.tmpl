# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Configures an Ory Network project's settings.

This resource manages the configuration of an Ory Network project, including authentication methods,
password policies, session settings, CORS, and more.

~> **Note:** This resource does not perform drift detection. The Read operation does not fetch current configuration from the API, so changes made outside of Terraform (e.g., via Ory Console or API) will not be detected by `terraform plan`. To re-sync, remove the resource from state and re-import it.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_project_config/resource.tf" }}

## Duration Format

Time-based attributes use Go duration strings. Examples:

| Duration | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `30m` | 30 minutes |
| `1h` | 1 hour |
| `24h0m0s` | 24 hours |
| `168h` | 7 days |
| `720h` | 30 days |
| `8760h` | 365 days |

## Import

Import using the project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project_config.main <project-id>
```

### Avoiding "Forces Replacement" After Import

After importing, if Terraform shows `project_id forces replacement`, ensure your configuration matches:

**Option 1: Explicit project_id**
```hcl
resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
  # ... other settings
}
```

**Option 2: Use provider default** (recommended)
```hcl
provider "ory" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
}

resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  # project_id inherits from provider
  # ... other settings
}
```

## Notes

- Project config cannot be deleted - it always exists for a project
- Deleting this resource from Terraform state does not reset the project configuration
- The `project_id` attribute forces replacement if changed (you cannot move config to a different project)
