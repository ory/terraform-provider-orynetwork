# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Configures an Ory Network project's settings.

This resource manages the configuration of an Ory Network project, including authentication methods,
password policies, session settings, CORS, and more.

This resource supports drift detection — `terraform plan` will detect changes made outside of Terraform (e.g., via Ory Console or API) for any attributes you have configured.

~> **Note:** Only attributes present in your Terraform configuration are tracked for drift. Attributes you have not configured will not appear in plan output, even if they have non-default values in the API.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_project_config/resource.tf" }}

## Duration Format

Time-based attributes use Go duration strings. Examples:

| Duration | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `30m` | 30 minutes |
| `1h` | 1 hour |
| `24h0m0s` | 24 hours |
| `168h` | 7 days |
| `720h` | 30 days |
| `8760h` | 365 days |

## Import

Import using the project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project_config.main <project-id>
```

### Avoiding "Forces Replacement" After Import

After importing, if Terraform shows `project_id forces replacement`, ensure your configuration matches:

**Option 1: Explicit project_id**
```hcl
resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
  # ... other settings
}
```

**Option 2: Use provider default** (recommended)
```hcl
provider "ory" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
}

resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  # project_id inherits from provider
  # ... other settings
}
```

## CORS Configuration

This resource supports CORS configuration for both public and admin endpoints:

- **Public CORS** (`cors_enabled`, `cors_origins`) — Controls CORS for public-facing endpoints (login, registration, etc.)
- **Admin CORS** (`cors_admin_enabled`, `cors_admin_origins`) — Controls CORS for admin API endpoints

## Notes

- Project config cannot be deleted — it always exists for a project
- Deleting this resource from Terraform state does not reset the project configuration
- The `project_id` attribute forces replacement if changed (you cannot move config to a different project)
- After `terraform import`, run `terraform plan` to reconcile your configuration with the current API state
