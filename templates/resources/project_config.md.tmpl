# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Configures an Ory Network project's settings.

This resource manages the configuration of an Ory Network project, including authentication methods,
password policies, session settings, CORS, and more.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_project_config/resource.tf" }}

## Import

Import using the project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project_config.main <project-id>
```

### Avoiding "Forces Replacement" After Import

After importing, if Terraform shows `project_id forces replacement`, ensure your configuration matches:

**Option 1: Explicit project_id**
```hcl
resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
  # ... other settings
}
```

**Option 2: Use provider default** (recommended)
```hcl
provider "ory" {
  project_id = "the-exact-project-id-you-imported"
}

resource "ory_project_config" "main" {
  # project_id inherits from provider
  # ... other settings
}
```

## Notes

- Project config cannot be deleted - it always exists for a project
- Deleting this resource from Terraform state does not reset the project configuration
- The `project_id` attribute forces replacement if changed (you cannot move config to a different project)
