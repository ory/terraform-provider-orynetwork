# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network project.

Projects are the top-level resource in Ory Network. Each project has its own
identity service, OAuth2 server, and configuration.

~> **Warning:** Destroying this resource **permanently deletes** the project and **all associated data** (identities, OAuth2 clients, sessions, etc.). This action cannot be undone.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_project/resource.tf" }}

## Environment Types

The `environment` attribute determines which features are available:

| Environment | Description | B2B Organizations | Rate Limits |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `prod` | Production environment with full features | Supported | Workspace plan limits |
| `stage` | Staging environment for testing | Supported | Development limits |
| `dev` | Development environment with limited features | **Not supported** | Development limits |

~> **Important:** If you plan to use `ory_organization` resources, you must use `prod` or `stage` environment.
The `dev` environment does not support B2B features.

## Home Regions

The `home_region` attribute determines where project data is stored:

| Region | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `eu-central` | Europe (default) |
| `us-east` | US East |
| `us-west` | US West |
| `us` | US |
| `asia-northeast` | Asia Northeast |
| `global` | Global |

## Plan Limits

Project creation may fail with HTTP 402 (Payment Required) if your workspace subscription does not allow additional projects. Upgrade your workspace plan or delete unused projects.

## Import

Projects can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project.main <project-id>
```

After import, you can reference the computed outputs:

```hcl
output "project_slug" {
  value = ory_project.main.slug
}

output "project_state" {
  value = ory_project.main.state
}
```
