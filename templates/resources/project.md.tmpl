# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network project.

Projects are the top-level resource in Ory Network. Each project has its own
identity service, OAuth2 server, and configuration.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_project/resource.tf" }}

## Environment Types

The `environment` attribute determines which features are available:

| Environment | Description | B2B Organizations |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `prod` | Production environment with full features | Supported |
| `stage` | Staging environment for testing | Supported |
| `dev` | Development environment with limited features | **Not supported** |

~> **Important:** If you plan to use `ory_organization` resources, you must use `prod` or `stage` environment.
The `dev` environment does not support B2B features.

## Import

Projects can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project.main <project-id>
```

After import, you can reference the computed outputs:

```hcl
output "project_slug" {
  value = ory_project.main.slug
}

output "project_state" {
  value = ory_project.main.state
}
```
