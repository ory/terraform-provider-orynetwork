# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network social sign-in provider (Google, GitHub, etc.).

Social providers are configured as part of the project's OIDC authentication method. Each provider is identified by a unique `provider_id` that is used in callback URLs.

## Provider Types

The `provider_type` attribute determines which OAuth2/OIDC integration to use:

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `google` | Google Sign-In |
| `github` | GitHub |
| `microsoft` | Microsoft / Azure AD (use `tenant` attribute) |
| `apple` | Apple Sign-In |
| `discord` | Discord |
| `facebook` | Facebook |
| `gitlab` | GitLab |
| `slack` | Slack |
| `spotify` | Spotify |
| `twitch` | Twitch |
| `generic` | Generic OIDC provider (requires `issuer_url`) |

~> **Note:** When using `provider_type = "generic"`, you **must** set `issuer_url` to the OIDC issuer URL. The provider uses OIDC discovery to find authorization and token endpoints automatically.

## Example Usage

## Mapper URL

The `mapper_url` attribute controls how OIDC claims are mapped to Ory identity traits. It accepts:

- A URL pointing to a hosted Jsonnet file
- A base64-encoded Jsonnet template prefixed with `base64://`

If not set, the provider uses a default mapper that extracts the email claim.

~> **Note:** The `mapper_url` value may be transformed by the API (e.g., stored as a GCS URL). The provider only tracks this field if you explicitly set it in your configuration to avoid false drift detection.

## Important Behaviors

- **`provider_id` and `provider_type` cannot be changed** after creation. Changing either forces a new resource.
- **`client_secret` is write-only.** The API does not return secrets on read, so Terraform cannot detect external changes to the secret.
- **`tenant` maps to `microsoft_tenant`** in the Ory API. This is only used with `provider_type = "microsoft"`.
- **Deleting the last provider** resets the entire OIDC configuration to a disabled state with an empty providers array.

## Import

Import using the provider ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_social_provider.google google
```

The `provider_id` is the unique identifier you chose when creating the provider. After import, you must provide `client_secret` in your configuration since it cannot be read from the API.
