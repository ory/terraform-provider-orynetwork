  Manages an Ory Network workspace. Import-only resource.
---

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network workspace.

Workspaces are organizational units that can contain multiple projects. Each workspace has one subscription plan that determines available features and rate limits.

-> **Plan:** Available on all Ory Network plans.

~> **Import-Only Resource:** Workspaces can only be created through the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh). Use this resource to import existing workspaces into Terraform and manage their name. The Ory API does not support workspace deletion, so destroying this resource will only remove it from Terraform state.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a workspace in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh)
2. Get the workspace ID from the Console URL or API
3. Add the resource block to your configuration:

```hcl
resource "ory_workspace" "main" {
  name = "My Workspace"
}
```

4. Import it into Terraform:

```shell
terraform import ory_workspace.main <workspace-id>
```

5. Run `terraform plan` to verify no changes are needed

## Limitations

- **Cannot create:** Attempting to create a workspace via Terraform will return an error. Workspaces must be created in the Ory Console.
- **Cannot delete:** The Ory API does not support workspace deletion. Destroying this resource only removes it from Terraform state; the workspace continues to exist in Ory Network.
- **Update:** Only the `name` attribute can be updated.

## Example Usage
