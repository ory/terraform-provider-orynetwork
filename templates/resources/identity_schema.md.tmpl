  Manages an Ory Network identity schema.

# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network identity schema.

## Important Notes

- **Schemas are immutable**: Identity schemas cannot be modified after creation. Any changes to the schema content or `schema_id` will require Terraform to destroy and recreate the resource.
- **Schemas cannot be deleted**: When this resource is destroyed, the schema remains in Ory but is no longer managed by Terraform.
- **Import is not supported**: Existing schemas created via the Ory Console or API cannot be imported into Terraform. To manage an existing schema, recreate it in your Terraform configuration using the same content.

## Understanding IDs

This resource has two ID-related attributes:

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `id` | The API-assigned identifier (may be a hash like `abc123def456...`). Read-only. |
| `schema_id` | Your chosen identifier (e.g., `customer`, `employee_v2`). You define this. |

When you create a schema with `schema_id = "customer"`, Ory may internally store it with a different ID (hash).
The `id` attribute tracks the API's internal ID, while `schema_id` tracks your chosen name.
