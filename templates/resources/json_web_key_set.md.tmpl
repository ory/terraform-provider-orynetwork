# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network JSON Web Key Set (JWKS).

JSON Web Keys are used for signing and encrypting tokens. This resource generates and manages custom key sets for your Ory project's OAuth2/OIDC service (Hydra).

~> **Note:** This resource is **immutable**. Any change to `set_id`, `key_id`, `algorithm`, or `use` will destroy the existing key set and create a new one. Private keys in the old set will be permanently lost.

## Algorithms

| Algorithm | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `RS256` | RSA | RSA with SHA-256 — widely supported, good default for signing |
| `ES256` | ECDSA | Elliptic curve P-256 — smaller keys, faster than RSA |
| `ES512` | ECDSA | Elliptic curve P-521 — stronger but slower than ES256 |
| `HS256` | HMAC | Symmetric — uses shared secret, not suitable for public verification |
| `HS512` | HMAC | Symmetric — stronger HMAC variant |

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_json_web_key_set/resource.tf" }}

## Keys Output

The `keys` attribute contains the JSON Web Key Set as a JSON string with **public parts only**. Private keys are never exposed in Terraform state. The output follows the standard JWKS format:

```json
{
  "keys": [
    {
      "kty": "RSA",
      "kid": "sig-key-1",
      "use": "sig",
      "alg": "RS256",
      "n": "...",
      "e": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

On read, the provider extracts `algorithm`, `use`, and `key_id` from the **first key** in the set.

## Import

Import using the set ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_json_web_key_set.signing token-signing-keys
```

After import, `key_id` is populated from the first key in the set. If the set contains multiple keys, only the first key's metadata is tracked.
