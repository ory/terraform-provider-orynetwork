# {{.Name}} ({{.Type}})

Manages an Ory Network OIDC dynamic client.

Dynamic clients are registered via RFC 7591 (Dynamic Client Registration). Unlike standard OAuth2 clients (`ory_oauth2_client`), dynamic clients are registered without prior authentication and receive a `registration_access_token` for RFC 7592 management.

After creation, the Terraform provider manages the client via the Ory admin API (not RFC 7592), so the `registration_access_token` does not need to be preserved for Terraform to function. However, you may want to store it if you plan to manage the client outside of Terraform.

-> **Plan:** Available on all Ory Network plans. Requires dynamic client registration to be enabled on the project.

~> **Prerequisite:** Dynamic client registration must be enabled on your Ory project. Enable it in the Ory Console under **OAuth2 > OIDC > Dynamic Client Registration**, or via the API by setting `/services/oauth2/config/oidc/dynamic_client_registration/enabled` to `true`.

~> **Important:** The `client_secret`, `registration_access_token`, and `registration_client_uri` are only returned when the client is created. They are not available after import or subsequent reads.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/resources/ory_oidc_dynamic_client/resource.tf" }}

## Import

OIDC dynamic clients can be imported using their client ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_oidc_dynamic_client.example <client-id>
```

**Note:** When importing, `client_secret`, `registration_access_token`, and `registration_client_uri` will not be available since these are only returned at creation time.
