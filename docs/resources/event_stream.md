# ory_event_stream (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network event stream.

Event streams allow you to publish Ory events (such as identity creation, session creation, etc.) to external messaging systems like AWS SNS.

-> **Plan:** Requires an Ory Network **Enterprise plan**.

~> **Authentication:** Event streams are managed via the Console API and require a `workspace_api_key` to be configured in the provider. A `project_api_key` alone is not sufficient.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Publish Ory events to an AWS SNS topic
resource "ory_event_stream" "events" {
  type      = "sns"
  topic_arn = "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:ory-events"
  role_arn  = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/ory-event-publisher"
}

output "event_stream_id" {
  value = ory_event_stream.events.id
}
```

## Import

Event streams can be imported using the event stream ID (uses the provider's `project_id`):

```shell
terraform import ory_event_stream.example <event-stream-id>
```

Or with an explicit project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_event_stream.example <project-id>/<event-stream-id>
```
