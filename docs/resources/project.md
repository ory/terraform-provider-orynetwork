# ory_project (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network project.

Projects are the top-level resource in Ory Network. Each project has its own
identity service, OAuth2 server, and configuration.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a production project
resource "ory_project" "production" {
  name        = "My Application - Production"
  environment = "prod"
}

# Create a staging project
resource "ory_project" "staging" {
  name        = "My Application - Staging"
  environment = "stage"
}

# Create a development project (note: no B2B Organizations support)
resource "ory_project" "dev" {
  name        = "My Application - Development"
  environment = "dev"
}

# Output the project details
output "production_project_id" {
  value = ory_project.production.id
}

output "production_project_slug" {
  description = "Use this for ORY_PROJECT_SLUG"
  value       = ory_project.production.slug
}
```

## Environment Types

The `environment` attribute determines which features are available:

| Environment | Description | B2B Organizations |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `prod` | Production environment with full features | Supported |
| `stage` | Staging environment for testing | Supported |
| `dev` | Development environment with limited features | **Not supported** |

~> **Important:** If you plan to use `ory_organization` resources, you must use `prod` or `stage` environment.
The `dev` environment does not support B2B features.

## Import

Projects can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_project.main <project-id>
```

After import, you can reference the computed outputs:

```hcl
output "project_slug" {
  value = ory_project.main.slug
}

output "project_state" {
  value = ory_project.main.state
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The display name of the project. This is shown in the Ory Console.

### Optional

- `environment` (String) The environment type. Must be one of: `prod` (production), `stage` (staging), or `dev` (development). Defaults to `prod`. **Cannot be changed after creation** - changing this will force a new resource. Note: `dev` environment does not support B2B Organizations.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the project (UUID format).
- `slug` (String) The project slug (e.g., `vibrant-moore-abc123`). This is auto-generated by Ory and used in API URLs. Use this value for `ORY_PROJECT_SLUG` or `project_slug` in provider configuration.
- `state` (String) The project state. Typically `running` for active projects.
