  timing      = "after"
  auth_method = "password"
  url         = "https://api.example.com/webhooks/welcome"
  method      = "POST"
  body        = <<-JSONNET
    function(ctx) {
      email: ctx.identity.traits.email,
      name: ctx.identity.traits.name,

    }
  JSONNET

# Pre-login validation
resource "ory_action" "validate_login" {
