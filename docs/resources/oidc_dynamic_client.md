# ory_oidc_dynamic_client (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network OIDC dynamic client.

Dynamic clients are registered via RFC 7591 (Dynamic Client Registration). Unlike standard OAuth2 clients (`ory_oauth2_client`), dynamic clients are registered without prior authentication and receive a `registration_access_token` for RFC 7592 management.

After creation, the Terraform provider manages the client via the Ory admin API (not RFC 7592), so the `registration_access_token` does not need to be preserved for Terraform to function. However, you may want to store it if you plan to manage the client outside of Terraform.

-> **Plan:** Available on all Ory Network plans. Requires dynamic client registration to be enabled on the project.

~> **Prerequisite:** Dynamic client registration must be enabled on your Ory project. Enable it in the Ory Console under **OAuth2 > OIDC > Dynamic Client Registration**, or via the API by setting `/services/oauth2/config/oidc/dynamic_client_registration/enabled` to `true`.

~> **Important:** The `client_secret`, `registration_access_token`, and `registration_client_uri` are only returned when the client is created. They are not available after import or subsequent reads.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Register a dynamic OIDC client
# Requires dynamic client registration to be enabled on the project
resource "ory_oidc_dynamic_client" "app" {
  client_name    = "My Application"
  grant_types    = ["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]
  response_types = ["code"]
  scope          = "openid offline_access"
  redirect_uris  = ["https://app.example.com/callback"]
}

output "client_id" {
  value = ory_oidc_dynamic_client.app.client_id
}

output "client_secret" {
  value     = ory_oidc_dynamic_client.app.client_secret
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Import

OIDC dynamic clients can be imported using their client ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_oidc_dynamic_client.example <client-id>
```

**Note:** When importing, `client_secret`, `registration_access_token`, and `registration_client_uri` will not be available since these are only returned at creation time.

- `id` (String) Internal Terraform ID (same as client_id).
- `registration_access_token` (String, Sensitive) The registration access token for managing this client via RFC 7592. Only returned on creation.
- `registration_client_uri` (String) The URI for managing this client registration via RFC 7592.
