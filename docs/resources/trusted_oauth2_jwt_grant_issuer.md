# ory_trusted_oauth2_jwt_grant_issuer (Resource)

Manages a trusted OAuth2 JWT grant issuer.

This resource creates a trust relationship that allows an external identity provider to authenticate via the OAuth2 JWT Bearer grant type (RFC 7523). The issuer provides a JSON Web Key (JWK) that Ory uses to verify JWT assertions.

-> **Plan:** Available on all Ory Network plans.

~> **Important:** This resource is **create and delete only**. Any changes require the resource to be recreated.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Trust an external identity provider for JWT Bearer grant
resource "ory_trusted_oauth2_jwt_grant_issuer" "idp" {
  issuer     = "https://jwt-idp.example.com"
  scope      = ["openid", "offline_access"]
  expires_at = "2027-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  subject    = "service-account@example.com"

  jwk = jsonencode({
    kty = "RSA"
    kid = "my-key-id"
    alg = "RS256"
    use = "sig"
    n   = "..."
    e   = "AQAB"
  })
}
```
