# ory_organization (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network organization.

Organizations represent tenants in a multi-tenant application. They can have associated SSO domains for automatic user routing and contain users (identities).

~> **Important:** Organizations require:
- An Ory Network **Growth plan or higher** with B2B features enabled
- The Terraform provider validates that the project environment is `prod` or `stage`. The `dev` environment is blocked by the provider, though the API may accept it in some cases.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an organization for multi-tenancy
resource "ory_organization" "acme" {
  label   = "Acme Corporation"
  domains = ["acme.com", "acme.io"]
}

output "organization_id" {
  value = ory_organization.acme.id
}
```

## Domains

The `domains` attribute is a list of email domains used for SSO routing. When a user signs in with an email matching one of these domains, they are automatically routed to this organization's SSO provider.

-> **Note:** Setting `domains` to `[]` and omitting `domains` entirely are treated differently in state. If you don't need domains, omit the attribute rather than setting it to an empty list to avoid plan drift.

## Import

Organizations can be imported using the organization ID (uses the provider's `project_id`):

```shell
terraform import ory_organization.acme <organization-id>
```

Or with an explicit project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_organization.acme <project-id>/<organization-id>
```
