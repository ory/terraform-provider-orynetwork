# ory_organization (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network organization.

Organizations represent tenants in a multi-tenant application. They can have associated SSO domains for automatic user routing and contain users (identities).

~> **Important:** Organizations require:
- An Ory Network **Growth plan or higher** with B2B features enabled
- The Terraform provider validates that the project environment is `prod` or `stage`. The `dev` environment is blocked by the provider, though the API may accept it in some cases.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Ensure your project is in prod or stage environment
resource "ory_project" "main" {
  name        = "My B2B App"
  environment = "prod"  # or "stage"
}

resource "ory_organization" "acme" {
  label      = "Acme Corporation"
  project_id = ory_project.main.id
  domains    = ["acme.com", "acme.io"]
}

output "organization_id" {
  value = ory_organization.acme.id
}
```

## Domains

The `domains` attribute is a list of email domains used for SSO routing. When a user signs in with an email matching one of these domains, they are automatically routed to this organization's SSO provider.

-> **Note:** Setting `domains` to `[]` and omitting `domains` entirely are treated differently in state. If you don't need domains, omit the attribute rather than setting it to an empty list to avoid plan drift.

## Import

Organizations can be imported using the organization ID (uses the provider's `project_id`):

```shell
terraform import ory_organization.acme <organization-id>
```

Or with an explicit project ID:

```shell
terraform import ory_organization.acme <project-id>/<organization-id>
```

## Schema

- `label` (String) Human-readable organization name.

### Optional

- `project_id` (String) The project ID. If not set, uses the provider's project_id. **Cannot be changed after creation** - changing this will force a new resource.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when the organization was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the organization.
