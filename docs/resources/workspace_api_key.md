# ory_workspace_api_key (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network workspace API key (import-only).

Workspace API keys (`ory_wak_...`) are used for workspace-level operations such as managing projects, organizations, and project configurations.

-> **Plan:** Available on all Ory Network plans.

~> **Import-Only Resource:** Workspace API keys can only be created through the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh). Use this resource to import existing workspace API keys into Terraform and track their lifecycle. The Ory API does not support managing workspace API keys when authenticating with another workspace API key.

~> **Warning:** Destroying this resource only removes it from Terraform state. The API key will continue to exist and remain valid in Ory Network. If you delete the key that the Terraform provider itself uses to authenticate, the provider will stop working. You must then update the provider configuration with a new workspace API key.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Create a workspace API key in the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh)
2. Save the key value securely (it is only shown once)
3. Add the resource block to your configuration:

```hcl
resource "ory_workspace_api_key" "main" {
  name = "My API Key"
}
```

4. Import it into Terraform:

```shell
terraform import ory_workspace_api_key.main <workspace-id>/<key-id>
```

5. Run `terraform plan` to verify no changes are needed

## Limitations

- **Cannot create:** Attempting to create a workspace API key via Terraform will return an error. Keys must be created in the Ory Console.
- **Cannot delete:** Destroying this resource only removes it from Terraform state; the key continues to exist and remain valid in Ory Network.
- **No updates:** Workspace API keys have no mutable attributes.
- **Value not available:** The `value` attribute is only shown once at creation time in the Console. It is not available via import or read.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Workspace API keys can only be created through the Ory Console.
# Use this resource to import and manage existing workspace API keys.
#
# Step 1: Add the resource block
resource "ory_workspace_api_key" "main" {
  name = "My API Key"
}

# Step 2: Import the key
# terraform import ory_workspace_api_key.main <workspace-id>/<key-id>
```

## Import

```shell
terraform import ory_workspace_api_key.main <workspace-id>/<key-id>
```

**Note:** When importing, the `value` attribute will not be available since it is only returned at creation time.
