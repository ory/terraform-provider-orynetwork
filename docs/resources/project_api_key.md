# ory_project_api_key (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network project API key.

API keys are used to authenticate API requests to a specific project.

**Important:** The `value` (the actual API key) is only returned when the key is created.
Store it securely immediately after creation.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ory_project_api_key" "backend" {
  name = "Backend API Key"
}

output "api_key" {
  value     = ory_project_api_key.backend.value
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Example with Expiration

```hcl
resource "ory_project_api_key" "temporary" {
  name       = "Temporary Key"
  expires_at = "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# API key for backend service
resource "ory_project_api_key" "backend" {
  name = "Backend Service"
}

# API key with expiration
resource "ory_project_api_key" "temporary" {
  name       = "Temporary Access"
  expires_at = "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}

# Multiple keys for different environments
resource "ory_project_api_key" "development" {
  name = "Development"
}

resource "ory_project_api_key" "staging" {
  name = "Staging"
}

resource "ory_project_api_key" "production" {
  name = "Production"
}

output "backend_api_key" {
  value     = ory_project_api_key.backend.value
  sensitive = true
}
```
