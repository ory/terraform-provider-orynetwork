# ory_project_api_key (Resource)

Manages an Ory Network project API key.

API keys are used to authenticate API requests to a specific project. They are scoped to a single project and provide the same level of access as the project owner.

~> **Important:** The `value` (the actual API key string) is **only returned when the key is created**. It cannot be retrieved afterward. Store it securely immediately after creation (e.g., in a secrets manager or as a sensitive output).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# API key for backend service
resource "ory_project_api_key" "backend" {
  name = "Backend Service"
}

# API key with expiration
resource "ory_project_api_key" "temporary" {
  name       = "Temporary Access"
  expires_at = "2026-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}

# Multiple keys for different environments
resource "ory_project_api_key" "development" {
  name = "Development"
}

resource "ory_project_api_key" "staging" {
  name = "Staging"
}

resource "ory_project_api_key" "production" {
  name = "Production"
}

output "backend_api_key" {
  value     = ory_project_api_key.backend.value
  sensitive = true
}
```

## Important Behaviors

- **Value is create-only.** The API key string is returned only on creation. Subsequent reads and plans will show the stored value from state but cannot refresh it from the API. If you lose the state, you lose the key.
- **Keys cannot be updated.** Changing `name` or `expires_at` after creation is not possible. All mutable-looking fields actually require replacement.
- **Read uses list API.** There is no direct "get by ID" endpoint. The provider lists all project API keys and filters by ID, which works but may be slower for projects with many keys.

## Import

Import using the API key ID, or a `project_id/key_id` pair:

```shell
# Using provider's default project_id
terraform import ory_project_api_key.backend <key-id>

# Specifying the project explicitly
terraform import ory_project_api_key.backend <project-id>/<key-id>
```

~> **Note:** After import, the `value` field will be empty because the API does not return key values. The key will still function, but Terraform state will not contain the secret.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A descriptive name for the API key.

### Optional

- `expires_at` (String) Optional expiration time in RFC3339 format (e.g., 2025-12-31T23:59:59Z).
- `project_id` (String) The project ID. If not set, uses the provider's project_id.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) When the API key was created.
- `id` (String) The API key ID.
- `owner_id` (String) The ID of the user who owns this API key.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The API key value. Only returned on creation.
