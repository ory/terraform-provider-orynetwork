# ory_project (Data Source)

Fetches information about an Ory project.

This data source retrieves basic metadata about a project. It can look up the project configured in the provider, or a specific project by ID.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Read the current project (from provider config)
data "ory_project" "current" {}

output "project_name" {
  value = data.ory_project.current.name
}

output "project_slug" {
  value = data.ory_project.current.slug
}

output "project_state" {
  value = data.ory_project.current.state
}

# Read a specific project by ID
data "ory_project" "other" {
  id = "other-project-uuid"
}
```

## ID Fallback Behavior

If `id` is not specified, the data source uses the `project_id` from the provider configuration. If neither is available, the read will fail with an error.

~> **Note:** This data source only returns basic project metadata (name, slug, state, workspace). It does not include the project's `environment`, `home_region`, or detailed configuration. Use `ory_project_config` to manage project settings.
